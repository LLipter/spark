<center>![spark-logo](assets/spark-logo-trademark.png)</center>


# Abstract

Spark is a general-purpose data processing engine that is suitable for use in a wide range of circumstances providing interfaces in a variety of programming languages including `Scala`, `Java` and `Python`. Application developers and data scientists incorporate Spark into their applications to rapidly query, analyze, and transform data at scale. Tasks most frequently associated with Spark include interactive queries across large data sets, processing of streaming data from sensors or financial systems, and machine learning tasks. As of 21-09-2018, the project has over 22,000 commits, 1285 contributors, 75 releases and has been forked over 16,000 times.

# Introdction

Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.
